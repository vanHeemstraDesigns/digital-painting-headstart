# Understanding Your Tools & Software

video: https://youtu.be/C9N0kCBwt7Y

In this video, I’m going to walk you through the software interface, so you know how all of the tools work!

I’ll be using Adobe Photoshop, but you can follow along in most software – many of the tools look & behave similarly.

Note: I’ve summarised some of the most important concepts from the video, but make sure to watch the video above as there are many more lessons in it!

## Canvas and Documents
The very first step of digital painting is to create a new document.
 
In Adobe Photoshop, you can do this by going to File > New Document, or by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL/CMD + N
 
Depending on your version of Photoshop, you’ll see a window with the following options:

The most important settings to remember are:
 
1. Width & Height: Use this to set the size of your canvas, in either Centimetres or Inches

2. Resolution: If you’re planning to print your artwork, use 300 Pixels/Inch. If you’re not planning to print it, use 72 Pixels/Inch – this will keep your file sizes smaller and make your computer run faster

3. Color Mode: Always start in RGB. If you want to print your artwork, you can switch this to CMYK later on.

## The Software Interface

The 3 most important part of the Photoshop software interface to remember are:

1. The Toolbox – this contains all of the tools you’ll need, like the brush, eraser, selection tools, etc.

2. The Options Bar – as you select tools in the toolbox, you’ll see that the bar at the top of the window changes, giving you different options for each tool

3. Panels – you can mix and match the panels that you find most useful for your own workflow. For now, I recommend you start with the Brushes, Layers, and Color panels

## Keyboard Shortcuts
To speed up your workflow, you should start to get familiar with using keyboard shortcuts.

Here are some of the most important Photoshop shortcuts to remember:

* B – Select the Brush Tool
* E – Select the Eraser Tool
* Z – Select the Zoom Tool
* M – Select the Marquee Tool
* Ctrl/Cmd + T – Use the Free-Transform Tool

When you have the Brush Tool (shortcut: B) selected, there are a number of shortcuts you can access by holding the following keys:

* Spacebar– Temporarily select Move Tool
* Spacebar + CMD/CTRL– Temporarily select Zoom Tool
* CMD/CTRL  – Temporarily select Eyedropper Tool
