Now that you understand the interface, let’s take a look at the most important tools & concepts…

Note: I’ve summarised some of the most important concepts from the video, but make sure to watch the video above as there are many more lessons in it!

## Layers
Layers can be one of the most useful features of digital painting, if you know how to use them.

By using layers, you can keep different elements of your painting separate. Whether it’s an object, a body part, a highlight or a shadow–painting them on different layers will give you the ability to tweak each element without risking the rest of your work.

The most important thing to remember about layers is this: the order that layers are listed in your Layers panel is the order they will show up on your canvas. Layers that are higher up will be placed on top of layers underneath them. You can drag and drop layers to change their order in an instant.

## Brushes & Erasers
As in traditional media, brushes & erasers are tools used to add and remove color, respectively.

The varieties of brushes used in digital painting are unlimited. In Photoshop, a unique brush stroke can be created by simply changing the brush tip, size, softness, shape, and even the pressure applied. If you miss the texture of traditional media, you can even use brushes that are designed to look like oil or watercolor!

As for erasers, they can be configured in the same way as brushes in terms of size, shape, and softness. The only difference is that they remove color instead of adding them.
